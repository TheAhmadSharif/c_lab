C is a general purpose procedural language. Dennis M. Ritchi is the father of this language.
It birth place was Bell Lab. Initially it was built for unix operaing system.

# String
This is a another type of data structure in c language. There are four ways to declare 
a string object in c. String is a type of array data. As it holds multiple character in a object. That's why String is also called array. 
------------------------------------------------------------------
char *variableName = "AhmadSharif"
char variableName[] = {"A", "B", "C"}; 
char variableName[] = "AhmadSharif"; 
------------------------------------------------------------------
char size is 1 byte. And it ranges between 0 to 255 or -127 to 128.
- It does not requrie to include <string.h> file in top to print just a string variable.
. It is requried to include <string.h> in top of the file when we have to use any 
built in function like strlen. There are some string based file are given below which I have used while learning.

- strlen(stringVariable)
- sizeof stringVariable;




%d for integer
%f for double
%li for long Integer
%0.2lf for 2 digit float number.

\n for new line;
\t for new tab;

%d for digits or intiger number.


' '      space 
'\t'     horizontal tab 
'\n'     newline
'\v'     vertical tab 
'\f'     feed 
'\r'     carriage return    








Natuarl numbers are used for counting objects. All non-negative integers are called Natural number. A number which is not
natural number is called composite number.
